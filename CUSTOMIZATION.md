# Prompt Customizations for Internal Use

This document describes the customizations made to original prompts to adapt them to the specific needs of the organization.

## Customization Structure

Customizations are organized in thematic directories:

- `/Custom/` - Contains all customized prompts
  - `/Custom/AgentTemplates/` - Base templates for internal agents
  - `/Custom/SpecializedAgents/` - Prompts for agents with specialized functions
  - `/Custom/Workflows/` - Configurations for multi-agent orchestration

## Customization Guidelines

1. **Maintain references to originals**
   - Each customized prompt must indicate the original prompt from which it is derived
   - Document the specific modifications made

2. **Versioning**
   - Use a clear versioning system for customized prompts
   - Maintain a change history with rationales

3. **Testing**
   - Document tests performed on customized prompts
   - Record performance metrics compared to originals
