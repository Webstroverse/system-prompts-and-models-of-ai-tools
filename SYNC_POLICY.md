# Upstream Synchronization Policy

This document defines when and how to synchronize this private fork with the original upstream repository.

## Synchronization Criteria

Synchronization with the upstream repository will be considered in the following circumstances:

1. Critical security or bug fixes
2. Significant improvements in prompt performance
3. New prompts relevant to the organization's use cases
4. Structural updates that improve maintainability

## Synchronization Process

1. **Review of upstream changes**
   - Analyze changes in the original repository
   - Evaluate impact on existing customizations

2. **Selective integration**
   - Integrate only relevant and compatible changes
   - Maintain priority for internal customizations

3. **Post-synchronization testing**
   - Verify that all customized functionalities remain operational
   - Ensure that performance is not degraded

4. **Documentation**
   - Document which upstream updates have been integrated
   - Specify any necessary changes to customizations
